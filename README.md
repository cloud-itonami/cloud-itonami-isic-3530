# cloud-itonami-isic-3530

Open Business Blueprint for **ISIC Rev.5 3530**: Steam and air conditioning supply.

This repository publishes a community thermal supply actor -- customer intake and meter verification, thermal-supply provisioning, thermal-supply suspension/disconnection (with life-support safety gates), and telemetry recording -- as an OSS business that any qualified thermal operator can fork, deploy, run, improve and sell, so municipal utilities, cooperatives, and independent operators can manage steam and chilled-water distribution safely, with auditable decision records and hard safety gates preventing disconnection of critical infrastructure (hospitals, emergency services), without renting a closed SaaS.

Built on this workspace's [`langgraph-clj`](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/langgraph-clj) StateGraph runtime (portable `.cljc`, supervised superstep loop, interrupts, Datomic/in-mem checkpoints) -- the same actor pattern as every cloud-itonami actor (thermal supply provisioning and suspension are negative actuations, requiring hard safety review before dispatch).

## Scope: what this actor does and does not do

This actor covers customer intake through meter verification, supply provisioning, and supply suspension/disconnection. It does **not** hold any distribution license required to run a thermal utility in a given jurisdiction. It also does **not** model real pressure-relief systems, real thermal composition/quality measurements, or the actual fluid mechanics -- no direct hardware dispatch protocol. Whoever deploys and operates a live instance (a licensed thermal operator) supplies any jurisdiction-specific safety standards, the real pressure/temperature/leak monitoring and the real SCADA tooling integrations, and bears that jurisdiction's liability -- the software supplies the governed, spec-cited, audited execution scaffold so that operator does not have to build the compliance layer from scratch.

### Actuation

**Dispatching a real thermal supply provisioning or suspension/disconnection is never autonomous, at any phase, by construction.** Two independent layers enforce this (`steam.governor`'s `:actuation/provision-supply`/`:actuation/suspend-supply` high-stakes gates and `steam.phase`'s phase table) -- see `steam.phase`'s docstring and test suite. The actor may draft, check and recommend; a human thermal operator is always the one who actually provisions or suspends a supply.

## The core contract

```
customer intake + identity + meter verification + telemetry observation
        |
        v
 Thermal Supply Advisor -> Thermal Safety Governor -> supply record, suspension record, or human approval
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + supply record + suspension record + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can provision or suspend a supply the governor refuses, approve a supply outside its verified customer scope, or publish a suspension record without governor approval and audit evidence. **A protected-recipient gate (life-support or critical-infrastructure meter) can never be suspended, even with human approval.**
