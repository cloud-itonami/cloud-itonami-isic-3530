  "Thermal Safety Governor (steam/chilled-water) -- the independent compliance layer that earns
  the Steam Supply Advisor the right to commit. The LLM has no notion of
  thermal-safety standards, whether a customer is actually eligible for
  provisioning, or when a supply provisioning or suspension is a real-world
  actuation (not a draft), so this MUST be a separate system able to
  *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  HARD violations (a human approver CANNOT override):
    1. Spec-basis       -- no official jurisdiction citation
    2. Evidence incomplete -- for actuation, required evidence checklist
    3. Protected recipient -- customer has life-support/critical-infra meter
    4. Already provisioned/suspended -- double-provisioning/suspension guard

  SOFT violation (can be approved by human):
    5. Confidence floor / actuation gate -- low confidence OR real actuation"
