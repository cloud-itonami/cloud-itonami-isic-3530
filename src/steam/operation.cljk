  "OperationActor -- one steam/chilled-water supply coordination run,
  expressed as a genuinely compiled langgraph-clj StateGraph binding the
  Thermal Supply Advisor, the Thermal Safety Governor, and the audit
  ledger.

  One graph run = one operation (intake -> advise -> govern -> decide ->
  commit | hold | request-approval -> commit). No unbounded inner loop --
  each run is auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow: `interrupt-before
  #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the decision to a
  human operator. The approver resumes with
  `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or `:rejected`).

  `:actuation/provision-supply`/`:actuation/suspend-supply` are NEVER in
  any phase's `:auto` set (steam.phase) and the governor's confidence-gate
  check independently forces them to escalate -- two layers agree
  actuation is always human-approved."
