(ns steam.store
  "SSoT for the steam actor, behind a `Store` protocol so the backend
  is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every cloud-itonami-isic-*
  actor uses:

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api`.

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/steam/store_contract_test.clj), which is the whole point: the
  actor, the Thermal Safety Governor and the audit ledger never know
  which SSoT they run on.

  Like every dual-actuation sibling, this actor has TWO actuation
  events (provisioning and suspending supply) acting on the SAME entity
  (a customer meter), each with its OWN history collection, sequence
  counter and dedicated double-actuation-guard boolean
  (`:supply-provisioned?`/`:supply-suspended?`, never a `:status` value)
  -- the same discipline every prior sibling governor's guards establish.

  The ledger stays append-only on every backend: 'which customer was
  verified, which supply was provisioned, which was suspended, on what
  jurisdictional basis, approved by whom' is always a query over an
  immutable log -- the audit trail a community trusting a thermal operator
  needs."
